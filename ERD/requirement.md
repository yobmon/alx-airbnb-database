# Airbnb Clone ‚Äì Database and System Requirements

## üìò Overview
This project is a simplified clone of **Airbnb**, designed to demonstrate a property rental marketplace system.  
It connects **hosts**, who list their properties, with **guests**, who can search, book, and pay for stays.

The core system supports **user management, property listings, bookings, payments, reviews, and messaging**.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Design and implement a relational database for an Airbnb-like platform.
- Ensure the schema follows **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to minimize redundancy.
- Enable the core functionality of:
  - User registration (guests, hosts, admins)
  - Property listing and management
  - Booking and payment processing
  - Review and messaging between users

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements

### üë§ User Management
- Users can register and log in.
- Roles determine access (guest, host, admin).
- Users can update personal information.

### üè† Property Management
- Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings.
- Guests can browse and search for properties.
- Each property displays price, description, location, and reviews.

### üìÖ Booking System
- Guests can book available properties for specific date ranges.
- Prevent overlapping bookings for the same property.
- Booking statuses: `pending`, `confirmed`, `canceled`.

### üí≥ Payment Handling
- Payments are linked to bookings.
- Supported methods: credit card, PayPal, Stripe.
- Payment details are stored securely (no raw card info).

### ‚úçÔ∏è Review System
- Guests can leave one review per completed booking.
- Ratings range from 1‚Äì5 stars.
- Reviews are displayed on property pages.

### üí¨ Messaging
- Guests and hosts can exchange messages.
- Messages include sender, recipient, content, and timestamp.

---

## ‚ö° Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security:** Passwords stored as hashes (bcrypt/argon2). Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- **Performance:** Proper indexing on primary and foreign keys for fast lookups.
- **Scalability:** Designed in 3NF to minimize redundancy and optimize storage.
- **Data Integrity:** Enforced with foreign key constraints and cascading deletes.
- **Reliability:** Timestamps for auditing and record history.
- **Portability:** Compatible with PostgreSQL or MySQL.

---

## üß† Database Normalization
- All tables satisfy **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:
  - No repeating groups or multi-valued columns.
  - Every non-key attribute depends on the entire primary key.
  - No transitive dependencies between non-key attributes.

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
- Add **Property Images** table for multiple images per listing.
- Add **Calendar/Availability** table for blocked dates.
- Add **Host Payouts** and **Service Fees** logic.
- Add **Notifications** (email/SMS) for bookings and messages.
- Add **Admin Dashboard** for moderation and reports.
